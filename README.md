## For students

- more than one student can work on a specific topic
- create a PR 
- publish your repository here after submitting the thesis to avoid plagiatorism
- topic is considered _finished_ if it has been either upstreamed or released as a software package in any other way
- it is ok to base your work on a published yet _unfinished_ results of previous students if there is still enough work to do
- please cite this list

## Contributions

- Have you ever thought why something has not been done yet? Would it make a great thesis topic?
- Are you a maintainer of an opensource project?
- Do you see a typo here?
- Did you find a way to improve a description of a specific thesis idea?

Please open a PR!

A PR adding new new entry to the main list MUST also include a `md` file in `ideas/` giving a reasonably thorough description.

**Disclamer: 
by contributing a thesis idea you are NOT required to commit to advising or reviewing the final thesis.
It is up students to find an advisers likely within their university.**
